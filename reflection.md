# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design

**a. Initial design**

- Briefly describe your initial UML design.
- What classes did you include, and what responsibilities did you assign to each?

- Owner
  - Attributes: name, pets
  - Actions: see user info, edit user info, see pet(s), add/remove/edit pet(s), view daily schedule, generate daily schedule
- Pet
  - Attributes: name, owners, tasks
  - Actions: see pet info, edit pet info, see owner(s), add/remove/edit owner(s), see tasks for this pet, add/remove/edit tasks for this pet
- Task
  - Attributes: name, associated pet(s), start time, end time, priority, user notes
  - Actions: view info, edit associated info
- Schedule (maybe optional, unsure if we can just use a list of tasks)
  - Attributes: tasks, explanation/description
  - Actions: view all tasks, edit tasks, edit order

This is a very rough draft.


**b. Design changes**

- Did your design change during implementation?
- If yes, describe at least one change and why you made it.

Yes. I refined the draft so it maps more directly to the README requirements (daily scheduling, constraints, and explainability):

- Kept `Owner`, `Pet`, and `Task`, but narrowed responsibilities so data classes store information and a dedicated planner class handles scheduling logic.
- Replaced the optional `Schedule` idea with two concrete classes:
  - `DailyPlan`: stores selected scheduled tasks + summary + explanation.
  - `ScheduledTask`: stores a task plus computed start/end times and reason chosen.
- Added `Scheduler` as the decision-making class. This class evaluates constraints (available minutes, priority, owner preferences/concerns, preferred time windows) and generates one plan across all pets for the owner.
- Removed many CRUD-style actions from UML methods (like “see/edit” for every field) and focused methods on behavior the project actually needs: adding tasks/pets, generating a plan, and explaining tradeoffs.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Owner {
        +name: str
        +available_minutes_per_day: int
        +preferences: list[str]
        +concerns: list[str]
        +pets: list[Pet]
        +add_pet(pet: Pet)
        +add_preference(pref: str)
    }

    class Pet {
        +name: str
        +species: str
        +tasks: list[Task]
        +add_task(task: Task)
        +remove_task(task_title: str)
    }

    class Task {
        +title: str
        +duration_minutes: int
        +priority: str
        +category: str
        +preferred_window: str
        +notes: str
    }

    class Scheduler {
        +generate_daily_plan(owner: Owner) DailyPlan
        +score_task(task: Task, owner: Owner) float
        +fits_constraints(task: Task, minutes_left: int) bool
        +explain_choice(task: Task, owner: Owner) str
    }

    class ScheduledTask {
        +task: Task
        +pet_name: str
        +start_time: str
        +end_time: str
        +reason: str
    }

    class DailyPlan {
        +owner_name: str
        +date: str
        +items: list[ScheduledTask]
        +minutes_used: int
        +minutes_available: int
        +summary: str
        +explanation: str
        +add_item(item: ScheduledTask)
    }

    Owner "1" --> "many" Pet : has
    Pet "1" --> "many" Task : needs
    Scheduler ..> Owner : reads constraints
    Scheduler ..> Task : scores/selects
    Scheduler ..> DailyPlan : builds
    DailyPlan "1" --> "many" ScheduledTask : contains
    ScheduledTask --> Task : schedules
```

To reduce implementation risk before coding, I made a few optimization-oriented refinements for readability, consistency, and scheduler stability:

- **Data consistency:** Replace free-form strings (like priority and time window) with controlled values (enum-like constants) to prevent invalid inputs.
- **Scheduling reliability:** Add deterministic tie-breakers when two tasks score equally, so schedules are reproducible and easier to test.
- **Constraint clarity:** Mark tasks as required vs optional so must-do care (for example meds/feeding) is protected when time is limited.
- **Separation of concerns:** Keep scheduler orchestration separate from score-factor tracking so explanations do not recompute logic.
- **Time representation:** Use minutes-from-midnight internally and format to readable clock strings only for display.

        +name: str
        +available_minutes_per_day: int
        +preferences: list[str]

        +pets: list[Pet]
        +add_pet(pet: Pet)
        +add_preference(pref: str)
    }

    class Pet {
        +name: str
        +species: str
        +tasks: list[Task]
        +add_task(task: Task)
        +remove_task(task_title: str)
    }

    class Task {
        +title: str
        +duration_minutes: int
        +priority: Priority
        +category: str
        +preferred_window: TimeWindow
        +is_required: bool
        +notes: str

### Simplified Design (4-Class Version)

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Task {
        +description: str
        +time_minutes: int
        +frequency: str
        +is_complete: bool
    }

    class Pet {
        +name: str
        +species: str
        +tasks: list[Task]
        +add_task(task: Task)
        +remove_task(description: str)
    }

    class Owner {
        +name: str
        +pets: list[Pet]
        +add_pet(pet: Pet)
        +get_all_tasks() list[Task]
    }

    class Scheduler {
        +get_pending_tasks(owner: Owner) list[Task]
        +organize_by_time(tasks: list[Task]) list[Task]
        +mark_complete(task: Task)
        +generate_schedule(owner: Owner) list[Task]
    }

    Owner "1" --> "many" Pet : owns
    Pet "1" --> "many" Task : has
    Scheduler ..> Owner : reads from
```

**Final design choices:**

- **Task** is a plain data container — no logic, just the facts about one activity (what it is, how long, how often, done or not).
- **Pet** owns its tasks directly. This keeps pet-specific data together and makes it easy to add or remove tasks per pet.
- **Owner** is the single entry point for the rest of the system. `get_all_tasks()` flattens tasks across all pets so the Scheduler doesn't need to know about the Owner → Pet → Task chain itself.
- **Scheduler** is the only class with real logic. It depends on Owner (via a dashed arrow) but doesn't store any state — it just reads, organizes, and returns. This keeps it easy to swap out or test independently.
- The original 6-class design added `SchedulingContext`, `ScoredTask`, `ScheduledTask`, `DailyPlan`, and two enums. Those are useful if you need time-window scoring or a printable daily plan, but for a minimal working scheduler they're unnecessary complexity.

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

- What constraints does your scheduler consider (for example: time, priority, preferences)?
- How did you decide which constraints mattered most?

Time, priority, and preferences are all considered in the scheduling the algorithm. The user can specify whether to sort by start time or priority within the UI, and the scheduler will follow the user's preferences.

**b. Tradeoffs**

- Describe one tradeoff your scheduler makes.
- Why is that tradeoff reasonable for this scenario?

---

The conflict detection implementation is currently a quadratic algorithm rather than logarithmic, but this is necessary in order to capture non-adjacent overlaps (e.g. if task A spans tasks B and C). Libraries like `intervaltree` may also be considered if a logarithmic time complexity is needed.

## 3. AI Collaboration

**a. How you used AI**

- How did you use AI tools during this project (for example: design brainstorming, debugging, refactoring)?
- What kinds of prompts or questions were most helpful?

**b. Judgment and verification**

- Describe one moment where you did not accept an AI suggestion as-is.
- How did you evaluate or verify what the AI suggested?

---

## 4. Testing and Verification

**a. What you tested**

- What behaviors did you test?
- Why were these tests important?



**b. Confidence**

- How confident are you that your scheduler works correctly?
- What edge cases would you test next if you had more time?
